#Python Alarm Clock
An alarm clock is a clock with a function that can be activated to ring at a time set in advance, used to wake someone up. In this project, I'll guide you through how to write a Python program to create an alarm clock using Python.

#Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you begin, you'll need to ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

Python 3.x
playsound library (can be installed using pip install playsound)
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.

#Running the code
The script will prompt you to enter the time for the alarm in the format HH:MM:SS AM/PM.

The alarm will play the specified audio file when the set time is reached.
To test the code, set the time a few minutes later than the current time.

Example
Enter the time of alarm to be set (HH:MM:SS AM/PM):
07:30:00 AM
Setting up alarm...
Built With
Python - The programming language used.
